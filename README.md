# Monte Carlo Method

## Run the program

To start building the program, press the green Start button on the Visual Studio toolbar, or press F5 or Ctrl+F5. Using the Start button or F5 runs the program under the debugger.

## About The Project

Simple application which is using Monte Carlo Method. Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. In this particular project, its calculating pi number.

## Built With

Simply clean C#
